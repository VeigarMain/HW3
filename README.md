# Homework3- Password Generator


# Description
I created a responsive password generator that uses HTML, CSS, and JS.
IN this HW assignment, I used JS to make elevated changes to my HTML document.

# Features
I created countless features to ensure the user is directed to a prompt screen and inside that prompt screen the user will find alerts to ensure user interaction.
When a user clicks ok, they will be prompted another alert that will ask the user a series of questions in order to create their password.
Once the user is done with the prompt screen, a password will be generated as long as the user clicks the "Generate password" button.
The for loop created in one of the functions clearly proves that once the user isn't satisfied with the first password generated, that the user may continue click the "Generate password" button to recieve different types of passwords.

## Features 
There are 4 documents or files inside of my HW3 folder.
There is a index.html file which uses the script.js file to create a reactive password generator, that also uses a style.css file to ensure that the wire-frame is mimicked and that the correct parameters have been installed to ensure the website looks how the instructor wants it too.
